# Tech Support

[CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/) deletes junk files and invalid windows registry entries.

[CCEnhancer](https://singularlabs.com/software/ccenhancer/) modifies CCleaner, allowing it to delete junk files from a wider variety of apps.

[TFC](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/tfc/) is a useful pre-cleaning tool. It targets the folders that can cause CCleaner to hang on slow PCs. Run this first, then try CCleaner again.
